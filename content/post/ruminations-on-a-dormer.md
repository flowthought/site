Something that came off the top of my head when it was raining outside one night and I couldnâ€™t sleep.
<!--more-->

It is now close to 3.30 and I'm still not over the sugar rush. Having slept most of the day, I've never been more awake.

It's raining like crazy outside. The blackness of the night is alive by the sounds of pounding drops. All night watchmen have run into shelter and there's not a single soul visible.

I'm hungry, and I've made the last pack of Maggi Noodles. Standing outside in the wet rainy corridor and again in my own balcony, I realize how beautiful the night can be when it rains in the middle of summer.

There is a single streetlamp outside my balcony, which is the only light I can see. It's illuminating the wavy canopy of plants below, plants which have come alive from the sporadic caresses of the blowing wind. Now and then, a bolt of lightning is visible and the sound of clouds rends the air.

There is peace in the turbulence. There is calmness in the patterning raindrops. It is an excellent time to think clearly and write.

The night is a great time for such moments.

As I finish my night snack however, the only thing that pulls me back from typing out sentences fervently is my drowsiness and I realize I have to go to work tomorrow.

The rain is now slowing down and the lightning is less frequent. The blowing turbulence of the wind has softened into gentle caresses. The night is calm and still again. No plants blowing, no drops pouring.

I feel the last breath of wind on my face as I close the door of my balcony and come back to bed.

I do not need the air conditioner any more.

Meta: Something that came off the top of my head one day last month when it was raining outside one night and I couldn't sleep. A dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface, usually having a window. Since I was standing in my balcony, I decided to abuse the meaning a little.
